# Practical Lab 3 Bonus

The ```bonuscanadamap.html``` file in my GitHub can be used as a supporting learning resource for elementary students and teachers to learn and teach about Canada's provinces and territories. Specifically, this resource can be used for the Grades 1-6 Ontario Social Studies Curriculum, but there are many cross-curricular opportunities as well, as described below. 

The map can be accessed via the following URL:
